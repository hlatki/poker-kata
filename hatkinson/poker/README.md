My attempt at solving the [Poker Hand Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataPokerHands)
for the August Coding Dojo.

It's in Clojure.

## Installation
You need Clojure (and probably also lein)

## Usage
I didn't write a driver, but there are quite a few testcases for comparing hands (test/poker/core_test.clj)


## Test

  lein test

## To Do
[] Make it more idiomatic
[] Do some optimization
